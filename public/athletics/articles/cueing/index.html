This is not to say that cueing is not effective or applicable - technical cueing is obviously a useful tool in the toolbelt of any coach. However, understand that a cue given in isolation will mean different things to different athletes based on their physical organization and coordination.\nWe cannot ask certain things of a start position and different things in receiving overhead. Over the course of a dynamic technical movement like the snatch, it is not likely to see changes in muscular coactivation patterns during the 1-2s elapsed as the bar is pulled to the hip. If the athlete does not have control of the pelvis or shoulder blade as they set up off the floor, neither will they as they transition under the bar. In this case, we will want to first address this coordination out from under the bar. These are fundamental pieces to optimal movement that are increasingly difficult to pick up when they are layered with a demanding movement such as the snatch. The same goes for control of the hip, ankle, and other joints. The problem is most likely not just in the snatch or clean \u0026 jerk, however the intense demands these movements place on organization and coordination tend to highlight any deficiency that might be present.\nI believe the “shoulders back, chest up” cueing is, in part, responsible for the archetypal recreational Weightlifter that exhibits fast hip rise, inability to reverse the position towards the top of the pull, forward jump or looping bar path, and overextended unsteady receiving position. Taking each of these faults in isolation, we may be inclined to apply further cues to address each one; “use your legs” in response to hip rise, “heels!” as the weight balance ends up forward, “chest up, straight finish!” as the hips come forward to meet the bar, and so on.\nThis is not to fault the well-intentioned coach or athlete, but a byproduct of the physical organization created as an athlete attempts to “shoulders back, chest up”. And no matter how “tight” the upper back and shoulders, or how upright the chest and arched the back, the technical issues seem to persist. It is no wonder that, in observing the Hookgrip slow-mo videos from the latest international meet, athletes often call into question the seemingly neutral-flexed backs of the best Weightlifters in the world - why aren’t they using this same arch that I’m taught? Should your back be arched? It depends on the load.\nLet’s think about the result:\nShoulders back, chest up archetype\nIntended result : bar is kept nearer in the pull, bar is brought back into the hips with an upright posture for a vertical extension\nTo think of “shoulders back” in the starting position of snatch or clean is generally going to mean pinching together and elevating the shoulder blades for the athlete.\nDr. Kelly Starrett “good positions give you more options” Its not a cueing problem, its an organizational problem\nHey can you take a big breath there? Often the positional issues will self-correct with this awareness - can i maintain my breath function in the position I’m in?\nThe athlete must start to understand the position they are in good position vs. bad position, which means a position where you have more movement options, generate more force, etc.\nAthlete should go through a process or movement and assess “how did that go”?\nMovement error or compensation without awareness is a situation to cue. Making mistakes is guaranteed to happen, but the awareness of this and subsequent correction is the goal.\nA cue should not be standalone, it should link or reference a fundamental skill or principle practiced out from under the barbell if the athlete is to develop the awareness.\n",
