  "articleBody": "This is an excerpt of my lecture given at the 2024 Martial Arts and Health Expo, taking place at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.\nMy name is Brandon, and I grew up in Sensei Susan’s dojo environment. Today, I am a scientist, I get paid to explore, investigate, and solve problems. Preparing for this seminar is a bit strange for me - typically in an academic context I might be speaking on some specific niche subject where I’ve applied and studied for years, i feel like i have some unique expertise. Here, I fully recognize and appreciate all of the experience in the room, this is quite humbling. I try to consider, what the heck do I have to offer to this group of experienced martial artists? It’s not knowledge or experience, but maybe it can be perspective, so that’s what I am intending for this seminar.\nI had the privilege to speak here last year as well and that conversation was centred around some tools and strategies for peak performance, I called it preparing for battle. Now for transparency, It wasn’t my first choice of title but Sensei Susan felt I needed to appeal to emotion and drum up some interest. It sounded pretty intense but in reality these were principles which are widely applicable to not just battle but pretty much any other activities we may wish to pursue. Because as martial artists we do prepare for battle, for physical conflict, with our training. But the reality is that we are not only warriors preparing for battle, but we are also students of the arts and teachers of the arts, and even promoters of the arts.\nOur pursuit of the arts prepare us not only for battle, but the studying, learning training eating sleeping - this vocation enriches so many broader aspects of our lives.\nSo, last year I spoke about 3 main concepts which tie into our practice as martial artists and can dictate our performance in different contexts; those three were Intent, Intensity, and Exposure.\nIntent ties into our purpose, our why. This can be our broader why, but can also be very specific. More broadly it can be why do I practice martial arts? More specific is Why am I in the Expo/dojo today, right now, what are we training for? what is the purpose, what am I intending to do or get from this?\nWhy are we here today? Can anyone share their why?\nIntensity. We match our intent with appropriate intensity to find success. We spoke about using our breathing to intentionally up or down regulate our states to match the demands of the situation. Peng You did an awesome job demonstrating this using both intentional breathing and movement to prime us at the ceremony this morning. Inhale and exhale, yin and yang balance of energy. Depending on the situation, we may wish to bias more towards one than the other.\nAnd we can be selective with this bias. Part of this means first being aware of our current state, our set point or energy, and deciding the type of energy that might best serve in what were intending to accomplish.\nAn example is proactively up regulating our state prior to something like sparring, and not taking for granted that the energy set point that we might have at work, driving to the dojo, is going to match the demands of the upcoming sparring session. We use breathing and movement to elevate our state in preparation, so we can meet the demands of the situation face first, and not have to react to them in retrospect. I like to pace up my breathing, keeping it regular and periodic, and bring in some movement. I like to jump, balls of my feet, start moving and breathing.\nI know we have some UFC fans in here, some may know Holly Holm, legendary mix martial artist. Before her UFC fights, when she enters the octagon, she has the same routine - a quick pace back and forth, turning on a dime with sharp breaths. While the announcer is doing his thing, she is preparing, bringing her energy and set point to meet the demands of the brutal conflict which is about to begin. Because by the time the first strikes are thrown, you want to be fully prepared.\nSome of us may even be able to relate to feeling over heightened ahead of a sparring session, and may in fact use breathing and movement to bring that set point down. The main idea is, we can take control in these moments to bring ourself to face the demands of the situation.\nWe can call this a state mismatch, where our energy or state is in some way not aligned with the demands of the situation, This can often cause uneasy feelings, perceived as stress, anxiety - overall, we may underperform if were not matching the demands of the situation.\nExamples of this might be when our body and mind prepares for battle, our blood pressure begins to climb and our temperature rises, we feel inclined to move - but we’re just waiting for a job interview. That is a state mismatch where our energy has elevated in anticipation of a physical confrontation - that probably or hopefully isn’t going to occur.\nUltimately we want the ability to move between states as needed, to take control. Thats where the third concept of Exposure or Practice comes in. By exploring different situations, different states, through repetition we can begin to adapt to these demands, for better and for worse. It comes full circle, if we are intentional with our pursuits and practice, we can better match our state to the situation and we can do this repeatedly to grow in this direction. That is progress. Because optimal performance is not a destination, it’s an ongoing practice that we can follow for life.\nI want to build on some of these concepts but at a different angle, something I have been thinking about recently. We have a ton of experience in the room today and I would like to tap into that. Throughout this discussion please involve yourself by raising your hand and sharing a thought, idea, or question - I want this to be interactive. Last year I had some very interesting conversations after the seminar concluded that I feel like we could all benefit from hearing so I actually want to keep this sort of like a round table amongst us.\nMany of us here may identify as teachers, coaches, or leaders: Sensei\nWe carry the responsibility of the arts in sharing them, and helping others to grow in their light, as is the way of the arts.\nHowever, we also hold this influence over ourselves.\nWho here has a sensei? or coach, or mentor. Someone who guides and facilitates learning and growth. Maybe that person is here, or far away. Id love for anyone to share a small anecdote or teaching from their sensei that might benefit the rest of us? Nugget of knowledge or wisdom.\nI think we can all agree though that we don’t have that coach or sensei with us all day, every day? So who takes over? You.\nYou are your own sensei first.\nThat means you are the student, and you are the teacher. The way in which we guide ourselves through life’s experiences is the same as the teacher to the student.\nJust as each student benefits from personalized instruction, where their own understanding, awareness and emotions are considered in what they need to learn and grow, we too can benefit from considering our own attributes when dealing with ourselves. Maybe this is obvious, but let’s go deeper.\nYou are also one more distinctive piece - the Competitor. The one which challenges ourself to be better, learn more, go further.\nWe are all three of these: the student, the teacher, and the competitor - At any moment, we are the superposition, all three occurring at once. Let’s say three bodies in one. The balance may swing further in one direction depending on the context, and to link back to our earlier concepts, depending on our intent, but elements of each are always present in us and how we interact with the world.\nLet’s list together some characteristics of each, let’s say what are the qualities of exceptional ones: students, teachers, and competitors. Now notice then there may be particular attributes which lend themselves to each of these, but we notice these qualities are almost universal.\nFor me, Student - patient, creative, curious. Teacher - engaging and educational. Competitor - disciplined and determined. When we lay these out we quickly see how these qualities are just as applicable to one as they are another, but maybe expressed more strongly. I think we can agree that to be exceptional is to practice these universal qualities in all contexts.\nSome of the most impactful lessons are taught during or facilitated by competition; lessons about ourself and about others. Competition is a teacher. Does anyone agree? As a student, you may feel the competitive rankings manifest during examination in the classroom, and gameplay at recess. Being studious is also competing against your prior self towards knowledge and understanding that you hadn’t expressed previously. Of course, we are still the student even while teaching, as I’ve learned as much about myself and others by teaching, by having discussions and conversations like this, as I have from formal studies. I am very much a student up here today, ready to learn.\nSo let’s tie our three earlier principles into the three bodies we’re talking about today. We use our intention to guide our state, where am I and what am I trying to do? Let’s talk about why we’re here in this seminar? Have you been able to match your state to be receptive to new ideas, perspectives? Have you been able to transition from more physical and dynamic sessions to those which are low intensity? This is actually really interesting because reflecting on this, I believe the Expo caters to all three: the student in our countless learning opportunities, I’ve been a student to many people here, the teacher in our ability to discuss and share our own unique ideas with others, and I saw competitors Friday night during belt testing, for sure.\nHere is something I’ve noticed: I feel most balanced when I am fulfilling the purpose of the student, the teacher, and the competitor. At different times, the balance might look different, but staying aligned for me is staying true to these characters. And if I find myself too far in one direction, or too disconnected from another, I don’t feel that Im performing at my best. Can anyone relate? If the competitor does not apply themselves In learning, they are sure to be surpassed by the competition. And if the student does not challenge and compete even with themselves, where is the drive to improve? And if the teacher does not apply themselves in learning, well that speaks for itself.\nThe Expo gives a great balance of these and I believe this is one reason why we all enjoy this weekend so much. We have the opportunity to fulfill our purpose in many different ways, to grow as martial artists and leaders.\nIm bringing awareness to these ideas because I want to encourage all of us to also be aware when we are in different situations, so we can adapt and adjust our state to meet our intention, our purpose. Honestly, I believe that we find our own optimal performance right at the interface between these ideas.\nWe can say optimizing performance, but this means different things to different people, in different situations. So this is why I am encouraging you to be intentional and exceptional as a student, as a teacher, and as a competitor. When it is your chance to learn, be passionately curious, focused, creative. When it is your chance to educate, bring enthusiasm, engagement and passion with your teaching. And when it is time to compete, do so with discipline, honour, and determination. These three make us whole as artists, martial artists. So go out and learn, and share, and encourage yourself and others to do and be more. And when you are tired of being the student, teacher, and competitor, tonight at the banquet we can unwind and unleash the fourth character which is the partier.\nGoing further: Optimize our performance by understanding ourselves.\nLets together build the exceptional student and understand how we can integrate these qualities into our own experience. We might notice that some of these attributes align with how we see ourself, and some which maybe we are exemplifying to the fullest extent. If so, there is opportunity for intentional improvement. Put your intention there! Lets do the same for the exceptional teacher\nAnd the competitor\nWhat are these qualities and how can we exemplify them? How can we create intentional practice? Is it enough to practice Kata, or to practice Kata with the intention on power and precision, or fluidity and movement? Are you the competitor during practice, or the student? Maybe you’re the teacher. By understanding the qualities and characteristics of each, we can lean into and leverage these to benefit ourselves and others. Training can and should be competitive. Competing with your evolving self, yes, and often with our training partners. But then training will also have studious portions, and parts where we are translating our knowledge to others. So depending on the training context, I’m encouraging you to be aware of which qualities might best serve you based on your intention.\nI hope that some of these perspectives and ideas you’ve found interesting, maybe inspiring you to develop them further and add your own perspectives. If you have something to share lets do so now. And if this has all felt very esoteric, then we can get really practical right now too. Does anyone have a question or curiosity ?\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p><em>This is an excerpt of my lecture given at the 2024 Martial Arts and Health Expo, taking place at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.</em></p>
<p>My name is Brandon, and I grew up in Sensei Susan’s dojo environment. Today, I am a scientist, I get paid to explore, investigate, and solve problems. Preparing for this seminar is a bit strange for me - typically in an academic context I might be speaking on some specific niche subject where I’ve applied and studied for years, i feel like i have some unique expertise. Here, I fully recognize and appreciate all of the experience in the room, this is quite humbling. I try to consider, what the heck do I have to offer to this group of experienced martial artists? It’s not knowledge or experience, but maybe it can be perspective, so that’s what I am intending for this seminar.</p>
<p>I had the privilege to speak here last year as well and that conversation was centred around some tools and strategies for peak performance, I called it preparing for battle. Now for transparency, It wasn’t my first choice of title but Sensei Susan felt I needed to appeal to emotion and drum up some interest. It sounded pretty intense but in reality these were principles which are widely applicable to not just battle but pretty much any other activities we may wish to pursue. Because as martial artists we do prepare for battle, for physical conflict, with our training. But the reality is that we are not only warriors preparing for battle, but we are also students of the arts and teachers of the arts, and even promoters of the arts.</p>
<p>Our pursuit of the arts prepare us not only for battle, but the studying, learning training eating sleeping - this vocation enriches so many broader aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>So, last year I spoke about 3 main concepts which tie into our practice as martial artists and can dictate our performance in different contexts; those three were Intent, Intensity, and Exposure.</p>
<p>Intent ties into our purpose, our why. This can be our broader why, but can also be very specific. More broadly it can be why do I practice martial arts? More specific is Why am I in the Expo/dojo today, right now, what are we training for? what is the purpose, what am I intending to do or get from this?</p>
<p>Why are we here today? Can anyone share their why?</p>
<p>Intensity. We match our intent with appropriate intensity to find success. We spoke about using our breathing to intentionally up or down regulate our states to match the demands of the situation. Peng You did an awesome job demonstrating this using both intentional breathing and movement to prime us at the ceremony this morning. Inhale and exhale, yin and yang balance of energy. Depending on the situation, we may wish to bias more towards one than the other.</p>
<p>And we can be selective with this bias. Part of this means first being aware of our current state, our set point or energy, and deciding the type of energy that might best serve in what were intending to accomplish.</p>
<p>An example is proactively up regulating our state prior to something like sparring, and not taking for granted that the energy set point that we might have at work, driving to the dojo, is going to match the demands of the upcoming sparring session. We use breathing and movement to elevate our state in preparation, so we can meet the demands of the situation face first, and not have to react to them in retrospect.
I like to pace up my breathing, keeping it regular and periodic, and bring in some movement. I like to jump, balls of my feet, start moving and breathing.</p>
<p>I know we have some UFC fans in here, some may know Holly Holm, legendary mix martial artist. Before her UFC fights, when she enters the octagon, she has the same routine - a quick pace back and forth, turning on a dime with sharp breaths. While the announcer is doing his thing, she is preparing, bringing her energy and set point to meet the demands of the brutal conflict which is about to begin. Because by the time the first strikes are thrown, you want to be fully prepared.</p>
<p>Some of us may even be able to relate to feeling over heightened ahead of a sparring session, and may in fact use breathing and movement to bring that set point down. The main idea is, we can take control in these moments to bring ourself to face the demands of the situation.</p>
<p>We can call this a state mismatch, where our energy or state is in some way not aligned with the demands of the situation, This can often cause uneasy feelings, perceived as stress, anxiety - overall, we may underperform if were not matching the demands of the situation.</p>
<p>Examples of this might be when our body and mind prepares for battle, our blood pressure begins to climb and our temperature rises, we feel inclined to move - but we’re just waiting for a job interview. That is a state mismatch where our energy has elevated in anticipation of a physical confrontation  - that probably or hopefully isn’t going to occur.</p>
<p>Ultimately we want the ability to move between states as needed, to take control. Thats where the third concept of Exposure or Practice comes in. By exploring different situations, different states, through repetition we can begin to adapt to these demands, for better and for worse. It comes full circle, if we are intentional with our pursuits and practice, we can better match our state to the situation and we can do this repeatedly to grow in this direction. That is progress. Because optimal performance is not a destination, it’s an ongoing practice that we can follow for life.</p>
<p>I want to build on some of these concepts but at a different angle, something I have been thinking about recently. We have a ton of experience in the room today and I would like to tap into that. Throughout this discussion please involve yourself by raising your hand and sharing a thought, idea, or question - I want this to be interactive. Last year I had some very interesting conversations after the seminar concluded that I feel like we could all benefit from hearing so I actually want to keep this sort of like a round table amongst us.</p>
<p>Many of us here may identify as teachers, coaches, or leaders: Sensei</p>
<p>We carry the responsibility of the arts in sharing them, and helping others to grow in their light, as is the way of the arts.</p>
<p>However, we also hold this influence over ourselves.</p>
<p>Who here has a sensei? or coach, or mentor. Someone who guides and facilitates learning and growth. Maybe that person is here, or far away.
Id love for anyone to share a small anecdote or teaching from their sensei that might benefit the rest of us? Nugget of knowledge or wisdom.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree though that we don’t have that coach or sensei with us all day, every day? So who takes over? You.</p>
<p>You are your own sensei first.</p>
<p>That means you are the student, and you are the teacher.
The way in which we guide ourselves through life’s experiences is the same as the teacher to the student.</p>
<p>Just as each student benefits from personalized instruction, where their own understanding, awareness and emotions are considered in what they need to learn and grow, we too can benefit from considering our own attributes when dealing with ourselves. Maybe this is obvious, but let’s go deeper.</p>
<p>You are also one more distinctive piece - the Competitor.
The one which challenges ourself to be better, learn more, go further.</p>
<p>We are all three of these: the student, the teacher, and the competitor - At any moment, we are the superposition, all three occurring at once. Let’s say three bodies in one. The balance may swing further in one direction depending on the context, and to link back to our earlier concepts, depending on our intent, but elements of each are always present in us and how we interact with the world.</p>
<p>Let’s list together some characteristics of each, let’s say what are the qualities of exceptional ones: students, teachers, and competitors.
Now notice then there may be particular attributes which lend themselves to each of these, but we notice these qualities are almost universal.</p>
<p>For me, Student - patient, creative, curious. Teacher - engaging and educational. Competitor - disciplined and determined.
When we lay these out we quickly see how these qualities are just as applicable to one as they are another, but maybe expressed more strongly. I think we can agree that to be exceptional is to practice these universal qualities in all contexts.</p>
<p>Some of the most impactful lessons are taught during or facilitated by competition; lessons about ourself and about others. Competition is a teacher. Does anyone agree?
As a student, you may feel the competitive rankings manifest during examination in the classroom, and gameplay at recess. Being studious is also competing against your prior self towards knowledge and understanding that you hadn’t expressed previously.
Of course, we are still the student even while teaching, as I’ve learned as much about myself and others by teaching, by having discussions and conversations like this, as I have from formal studies. I am very much a student up here today, ready to learn.</p>
<p>So let’s tie our three earlier principles into the three bodies we’re talking about today. We use our intention to guide our state, where am I and what am I trying to do?  Let’s talk about why we’re here in this seminar? Have you been able to match your state to be receptive to new ideas, perspectives? Have you been able to transition from more physical and dynamic sessions to those which are low intensity?
This is actually really interesting because reflecting on this, I believe the Expo caters to all three: the student in our countless learning opportunities, I’ve been a student to many people here, the teacher in our ability to discuss and share our own unique ideas with others, and I saw competitors Friday night during belt testing, for sure.</p>
<p>Here is something I’ve noticed: I feel most balanced when I am fulfilling the purpose of the student, the teacher, and the competitor. At different times, the balance might look different, but staying aligned for me is staying true to these characters. And if I find myself too far in one direction, or too disconnected from another, I don’t feel that Im performing at my best. Can anyone relate? If the competitor does not apply themselves In learning, they are sure to be surpassed by the competition. And if the student does not challenge and compete even with themselves, where is the drive to improve? And if the teacher does not apply themselves in learning, well that speaks for itself.</p>
<p>The Expo gives a great balance of these and I believe this is one reason why we all enjoy this weekend so much. We have the opportunity to fulfill our purpose in many different ways, to grow as martial artists and leaders.</p>
<p>Im bringing awareness to these ideas because I want to encourage all of us to also be aware when we are in different situations, so we can adapt and adjust our state to meet our intention, our purpose. Honestly, I believe that we find our own optimal performance right at the interface between these ideas.</p>
<p>We can say optimizing performance, but this means different things to different people, in different situations. So this is why I am encouraging you to be intentional and exceptional as a student, as a teacher, and as a competitor.
When it is your chance to learn, be passionately curious, focused, creative. When it is your chance to educate, bring enthusiasm, engagement and passion with your teaching. And when it is time to compete, do so with discipline, honour, and determination. These three make us whole as artists, martial artists. So go out and learn, and share, and encourage yourself and others to do and be more. And when you are tired of being the student, teacher, and competitor, tonight at the banquet we can unwind and unleash the fourth character which is the partier.</p>
<p>Going further: Optimize our performance by understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>Lets together build the exceptional student and understand how we can integrate these qualities into our own experience. We might notice that some of these attributes align with how we see ourself, and some which maybe we are exemplifying to the fullest extent. If so, there is opportunity for intentional improvement. Put your intention there!
Lets do the same for the exceptional teacher</p>
<p>And the competitor</p>
<p>What are these qualities and how can we exemplify them? How can we create intentional practice? Is it enough to practice Kata, or to practice Kata with the intention on power and precision, or fluidity and movement? Are you the competitor during practice, or the student? Maybe you’re the teacher. By understanding the qualities and characteristics of each, we can lean into and leverage these to benefit ourselves and others. Training can and should be competitive. Competing with your evolving self, yes, and often with our training partners. But then training will also have studious portions, and parts where we are translating our knowledge to others. So depending on the training context, I’m encouraging you to be aware of which qualities might best serve you based on your intention.</p>
<p>I hope that some of these perspectives and ideas you’ve found interesting, maybe inspiring you to develop them further and add your own perspectives. If you have something to share lets do so now.  And if this has all felt very esoteric, then we can get really practical right now too. Does anyone have a question or curiosity ?</p>
