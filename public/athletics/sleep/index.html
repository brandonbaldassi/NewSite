There is no question that quality sleep is a necessary investment in our health - both current and future.  There is no exercise that will offset poor sleep, and no supplement that can replace it.  Quality sleep is an invaluable commodity not only for athletic performance and energy throughout the day - it is our singular greatest defence against degeneration and disease as we age.  Getting quality sleep - at the right times - is as essential to our health and performance as food and water.  

This article will outline the intricacies of sleep and the influence of our modern lifestyle and habits.  I will leave you with some practical strategies that you can apply immediately to promote and enhance quality sleep for health and performance.  It doesn’t have to be up to chance whether you will wake up tomorrow thinking “I had a great sleep”.  There are actionable steps to set the conditions to wake up each morning feeling rested and recovered.  This starts with understanding how our modern lifestyle and habits affect how we sleep.  


Optimal health and performance comes with respecting our programmed sleep and wake cycles - not rebelling against them.  The circadian clock regulates all of our body’s functions — not just sleeping and waking.  Regulation of body temperature, blood pressure, and levels of digestive enzymes and hormones are all dictated by our internal clock.  Now let&#39;s throw in some sleep disruption or deprivation.  Even one night of disrupted or deprived sleep will result in some level of insulin resistance and poor blood glucose regulation.  You will also see elevated levels of stress hormone cortisol which comes with its own array of physiological effects.  The cherry on top is the immune system inhibition that is also associated with this lack of effective and timely rest.

Given that the physiological effects of even slight sleep deprivation or disruption can be observed for days following, it becomes obvious that the notion of “catching up” on sleep on weekends or by napping is not going to counteract the effects of the accumulated sleep debt.  Consistent, quality sleep is the result of creating habit out of prioritizing the details surrounding your sleep.

Consistent, quality sleep is the result of creating habit out of prioritizing the details surrounding your sleep. All sleep states serve a unique and necessary purpose - evolution would have otherwise done away with them,\nThere are many good arguments for mandating the number of required sleep cycles over some period of time as opposed to focusing on Xhrs/night. Although thinking about sleep quantity in terms of cycles per week can alleviate some of the stress around adhering to a conventional sleep schedule and allow some flexibility, it may create the impression that a sleep schedule is less important than overall quantity - this is not the case. Basic sleep math should look like the following: Quality + quantity + consistency - prioritize all 3, get a minimum of 2/3 on any given night.\nFalling asleep\nWorking toward quality sleep starts in the morning, and by incorporating sun and movement early and often during the daytime, you will help to regulate your circadian rhythm and cue proper sleep time in the evenings. Waking up is the defining transition from sleep to wakefulness. Our conscious mind comes back on board, and our body’s systems prime themselves for action. Making a habit around sunlight, movement, and hydration within the first 5 waking minutes of each day will do wonders for ensuring our body and mind gets a definitive start to the day. And if you were looking for a reason to stop dragging your ass in the morning, this is it. Grabbing your phone after waking up and scrolling social, emails, or messages with one eye open does worse than accomplish nothing - it’s a surefire way to start your day with a muddy mind and stagnant body. Set the tone for the day by getting up, breathing deep, and moving, right away. Read more on morning routines here. Of equal importance in getting to sleep is respecting the transition as daylight fades into evening. Direct exposure to bright light in the evening mimics the daylight signal to our body, inhibits the hormones needed for transition to a restful sleep state, and shortens total sleep time. Melatonin is the sleep-related hormone produced by the pituitary gland as day fades into night, and is responsible for our normal sleep architecture. Blue light exposure in the evening hours suppresses melatonin production by greater than 50%, results in a later melatonin onset, and shortens the total time it is produced. This almost guarantees some amount of disfunction when we decide we do want to sleep, which is the reason that so many of us reach for a few melatonin tablets in the evening. Unfortunately, this is more of a bandaid solution than a fix, which is why you may find only temporary help from a melatonin supplement. To address the problem at the source, it is important to mirror the reduction in daylight with your indoor lighting, especially in the last hours before sleep. Small lamps or candles offering ‘warmer’ light are excellent alternatives to brighter overhead lighting. Blue-light blocking glasses are an awesome tool for the last 2 hours before your desired sleep time, as they will prevent you from receiving any further “daylight” signalling. In addition, if you find yourself working in front of a screen later into the evening, consider enabling night-time mode (where applicable) or utilizing a blue light filter such as f.lux (justgetflux.com). By reflecting this change with your indoor lighting, your body will begin to produce sleep time hormones needed for restful sleep. Staying asleep\nThere are numerous possible reasons that you may find yourself waking periodically or feeling restless during a night’s sleep. Environmental conditions may play a role, as might blood sugar, immune activity, sleeping positions, and so-on. To cover the basics, your sleeping environment should remain cool, something like 18-20°C. If you experience any breathing disruption like snoring\nSleeping better\nPractical Strategies\nHabits\nSet a schedule, and stick to it. Be as disciplined with your sleep time as your waking time. This means picking a time to start your evening wind-down and adhering to it every day. Both times should be relatively fixed if your body is to settle into a routine. Reserve the bed for sleeping. If part of your wind-down consists of reading or journaling, do this in another room or sitting on the floor.\nEnvironment\nAs the sun sets and your body receives the signals to begin transition from wakefulness toward sleep time, your indoor lighting should follow the same trend. Dim and minimize indoor artificial light wherever possible, and opt for warmer light sources such as incandescent lamps, salt lamps, or candles as opposed to brighter overhead lighting or white light. Blue light should be completely avoided. In our digital world, opt for blue light filters on all devices (f.lux) and employ blue light blocking glasses in the evenings for at least 2hrs before your desired sleep time.\nWearables\nTech, glasses,\nSupplements\nCaffeine should never be a consistent crutch to poor sleep quality or quantity - the stimulatory effects will only serve to worsen the deficit in time.\n——————————————————————————————————————————\nNotes\nSleep mechanisms\nCircadian rhythms direct a wide variety of functions from daily fluctuations in wakefulness to body temperature, metabolism, and the release of hormones. They control your timing of sleep and cause you to be sleepy at night and your tendency to wake in the morning without an alarm. Circadian rhythms synchronize with environmental cues (light, temperature) about the actual time of day, but they continue even in the absence of cues. Sleep-wake homeostasis keeps track of your need for sleep. The homeostatic sleep drive reminds the body to sleep after a certain time and regulates sleep intensity. This sleep drive gets stronger every hour you are awake and causes you to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation. Factors that influence your sleep-wake needs include medical conditions, medications, stress, sleep environment, and what you eat and drink. Perhaps the greatest influence is the exposure to light. Specialized cells in the retinas of your eyes process light and tell the brain whether it is day or night and can advance or delay our sleep-wake cycle. Exposure to light can make it difficult to fall asleep and return to sleep when awakened.\nYour time spent sleeping can be classified into two categories; rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (3 stages). During a night of sleep, you will cycle through the stages of REM and non-REM sleep numerous times, with a greater portion of the REM fraction occurring nearer to morning (figure 1). Each is linked to specific brain waves and neuronal activity. Athletes or those engaging in more physically demanding pursuits tend to benefit from greater quantities of slow wave (deep) sleep. This is due to the body’s unique physiological processes running in certain sleep cycles, for deep sleep, tissue repair etc. Deep slow wave sleep is characterized by slower, more synchronized brain waves.\nStage 1 non-REM sleep is the changeover from wakefulness to sleep Stage 2 non-REM sleep is a period of light sleep before you enter deeper sleep. Your heartbeat and breathing slow, and muscles relax even further. Your body temperature drops and eye movements stop. Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity. You spend more of your repeated sleep cycles in stage 2 sleep than in other sleep stages. Stage 3 non-REM sleep is the period of deep sleep that you need to feel refreshed in the morning. It occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night. Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep. REM sleep first occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep. Your eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids. Mixed frequency brain wave activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness. Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels. Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep\nA typical night’s sleep consists of four or five REM/non-REM cycles with occasional, brief episodes of wakefulness. Most deep sleep occurs during the first two to three hours of sleep. As morning approaches, REM sleep occupies an increasing share of slumber, often leaving us with a memory of a recent dream.\nDeep sleep - muscular tissue recovery, repair. Other processes slow, body temp drops, heart rate and blood pressure drop. At the onset of stage 4 deep sleep, we see the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. Cognitive recovery and repair, heightened brain activity when compared to deep sleep. The clearance of metabolic waste and toxins from the brain and nervous system occurs by way of the glymphatic system only during sleep.\nREM sleep - Here, you are consolidating the thoughts and memories of the day.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Preparing ourselves and our environment for restful sleep</p>
<pre><code>There is no question that quality sleep is a necessary investment in our health - both current and future.  There is no exercise that will offset poor sleep, and no supplement that can replace it.  Quality sleep is an invaluable commodity not only for athletic performance and energy throughout the day - it is our singular greatest defence against degeneration and disease as we age.  Getting quality sleep - at the right times - is as essential to our health and performance as food and water.  

This article will outline the intricacies of sleep and the influence of our modern lifestyle and habits.  I will leave you with some practical strategies that you can apply immediately to promote and enhance quality sleep for health and performance.  It doesn’t have to be up to chance whether you will wake up tomorrow thinking “I had a great sleep”.  There are actionable steps to set the conditions to wake up each morning feeling rested and recovered.  This starts with understanding how our modern lifestyle and habits affect how we sleep.  


Optimal health and performance comes with respecting our programmed sleep and wake cycles - not rebelling against them.  The circadian clock regulates all of our body’s functions — not just sleeping and waking.  Regulation of body temperature, blood pressure, and levels of digestive enzymes and hormones are all dictated by our internal clock.  Now let's throw in some sleep disruption or deprivation.  Even one night of disrupted or deprived sleep will result in some level of insulin resistance and poor blood glucose regulation.  You will also see elevated levels of stress hormone cortisol which comes with its own array of physiological effects.  The cherry on top is the immune system inhibition that is also associated with this lack of effective and timely rest.

Given that the physiological effects of even slight sleep deprivation or disruption can be observed for days following, it becomes obvious that the notion of “catching up” on sleep on weekends or by napping is not going to counteract the effects of the accumulated sleep debt.  Consistent, quality sleep is the result of creating habit out of prioritizing the details surrounding your sleep.  
</code></pre>
<p>All sleep states serve a unique and necessary purpose - evolution would have otherwise done away with them,</p>
<pre><code>There are many good arguments for mandating the number of required sleep cycles over some period of time as opposed to focusing on Xhrs/night.  Although thinking about sleep quantity in terms of cycles per week can alleviate some of the stress around adhering to a conventional sleep schedule and allow some flexibility, it may create the impression that a sleep schedule is less important than overall quantity - this is not the case.
</code></pre>
<p>Basic sleep math should look like the following: Quality + quantity + consistency - prioritize all 3, get a minimum of 2/3 on any given night.</p>
<p>Falling asleep</p>
<pre><code>Working toward quality sleep starts in the morning, and by incorporating sun and movement early and often during the daytime, you will help to regulate your circadian rhythm and cue proper sleep time in the evenings.  Waking up is the defining transition from sleep to wakefulness.  Our conscious mind comes back on board, and our body’s systems prime themselves for action.  Making a habit around sunlight, movement, and hydration within the first 5 waking minutes of each day will do wonders for ensuring our body and mind gets a definitive start to the day.  And if you were looking for a reason to stop dragging your ass in the morning, this is it.  Grabbing your phone after waking up and scrolling social, emails, or messages with one eye open does worse than accomplish nothing - it’s a surefire way to start your day with a muddy mind and stagnant body.  Set the tone for the day by getting up, breathing deep, and moving, right away.  Read more on morning routines here.  

Of equal importance in getting to sleep is respecting the transition as daylight fades into evening.  Direct exposure to bright light in the evening mimics the daylight signal to our body, inhibits the hormones needed for transition to a restful sleep state, and shortens total sleep time.  
Melatonin is the sleep-related hormone produced by the pituitary gland as day fades into night, and is responsible for our normal sleep architecture.  Blue light exposure in the evening hours suppresses melatonin production by greater than 50%, results in a later melatonin onset, and shortens the total time it is produced.  This almost guarantees some amount of disfunction when we decide we do want to sleep, which is the reason that so many of us reach for a few melatonin tablets in the evening.  Unfortunately, this is more of a bandaid solution than a fix, which is why you may find only temporary help from a melatonin supplement.  
To address the problem at the source, it is important to mirror the reduction in daylight with your indoor lighting, especially in the last hours before sleep.  Small lamps or candles offering ‘warmer’ light are excellent alternatives to brighter overhead lighting.  Blue-light blocking glasses are an awesome tool for the last 2 hours before your desired sleep time, as they will prevent you from receiving any further “daylight” signalling.  In addition, if you find yourself working in front of a screen later into the evening, consider enabling night-time mode (where applicable) or utilizing a blue light filter such as f.lux (justgetflux.com).  By reflecting this change with your indoor lighting, your body will begin to produce sleep time hormones needed for restful sleep.  
</code></pre>
<p>Staying asleep</p>
<pre><code>There are numerous possible reasons that you may find yourself waking periodically or feeling restless during a night’s sleep.  Environmental conditions may play a role, as might blood sugar, immune activity, sleeping positions, and so-on.  
</code></pre>
<p>To cover the basics, your sleeping environment should remain cool, something like 18-20°C.  If you experience any breathing disruption like snoring</p>
<p>Sleeping better</p>
<p>Practical Strategies</p>
<p>Habits</p>
<p>Set a schedule, and stick to it.  Be as disciplined with your sleep time as your waking time.  This means picking a time to start your evening wind-down and adhering to it every day.  Both times should be relatively fixed if your body is to settle into a routine.
Reserve the bed for sleeping.  If part of your wind-down consists of reading or journaling, do this in another room or sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>As the sun sets and your body receives the signals to begin transition from wakefulness toward sleep time, your indoor lighting should follow the same trend.  Dim and minimize indoor artificial light wherever possible, and opt for warmer light sources such as incandescent lamps, salt lamps, or candles as opposed to brighter overhead lighting or white light.  Blue light should be completely avoided.  In our digital world, opt for blue light filters on all devices (f.lux) and employ blue light blocking glasses in the evenings for at least 2hrs before your desired sleep time.</p>
<p>Wearables</p>
<p>Tech, glasses,</p>
<p>Supplements</p>
<p>Caffeine should never be a consistent crutch to poor sleep quality or quantity - the stimulatory effects will only serve to worsen the deficit in time.</p>
<p>——————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>Sleep mechanisms</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms direct a wide variety of functions from daily fluctuations in wakefulness to body temperature, metabolism, and the release of hormones.  They control your timing of sleep and cause you to be sleepy at night and your tendency to wake in the morning without an alarm.  Circadian rhythms synchronize with environmental cues (light, temperature) about the actual time of day, but they continue even in the absence of cues. </p>
<p>Sleep-wake homeostasis keeps track of your need for sleep.  The homeostatic sleep drive reminds the body to sleep after a certain time and regulates sleep intensity.  This sleep drive gets stronger every hour you are awake and causes you to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.
Factors that influence your sleep-wake needs include medical conditions, medications, stress, sleep environment, and what you eat and drink.  Perhaps the greatest influence is the exposure to light.  Specialized cells in the retinas of your eyes process light and tell the brain whether it is day or night and can advance or delay our sleep-wake cycle.  Exposure to light can make it difficult to fall asleep and return to sleep when awakened.</p>
<p>Your time spent sleeping can be classified into two categories; rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (3 stages).  During a night of sleep, you will cycle through the stages of REM and non-REM sleep numerous times, with a greater portion of the REM fraction occurring nearer to morning (figure 1).  Each is linked to specific brain waves and neuronal activity. </p>
<p>Athletes or those engaging in more physically demanding pursuits tend to benefit from greater quantities of slow wave (deep) sleep.  This is due to the body’s unique physiological processes running in certain sleep cycles, for deep sleep, tissue repair etc.  Deep slow wave sleep is characterized by slower, more synchronized brain waves.</p>
<p>Stage 1 non-REM sleep is the changeover from wakefulness to sleep
Stage 2 non-REM sleep is a period of light sleep before you enter deeper sleep.  Your heartbeat and breathing slow, and muscles relax even further.  Your body temperature drops and eye movements stop.  Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity.  You spend more of your repeated sleep cycles in stage 2 sleep than in other sleep stages.
Stage 3 non-REM sleep is the period of deep sleep that you need to feel refreshed in the morning.  It occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night.  Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep.
REM sleep first occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep.  Your eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids.  Mixed frequency brain wave activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness.  Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels.  Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep</p>
<p>A typical night&rsquo;s sleep consists of four or five REM/non-REM cycles with occasional, brief episodes of wakefulness. Most deep sleep occurs during the first two to three hours of sleep. As morning approaches, REM sleep occupies an increasing share of slumber, often leaving us with a memory of a recent dream.</p>
<p>Deep sleep - muscular tissue recovery, repair.  Other processes slow, body temp drops, heart rate and blood pressure drop.  At the onset of stage 4 deep sleep, we see the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.  Cognitive recovery and repair, heightened brain activity when compared to deep sleep.   The clearance of metabolic waste and toxins from the brain and nervous system occurs by way of the glymphatic system only during sleep.</p>
<p>REM sleep - Here, you are consolidating the thoughts and memories of the day.</p>
