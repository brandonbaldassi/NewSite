*This is an excerpt of my lecture given at the 2023 Martial Arts and Health Expo, taking place at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.*

First of all thank you to everyone here for taking part in the Expo and for attending my session today, I am excited for this opportunity to share some ideas about health and performance and I am also very humbled to be up here since I recognize that there is so much experience in the room collectively in training and martial arts, and I am really excited to talk with everyone, I encourage this to be an open discussion where we can challenge our own ideas, challenge my ideas, with the intention that we can all leave with some new insights or perspectives. 

I started training in Sensei Susan’s dojo when I was 2yrs old when I was underage still for her kids class. Over the years I’ve spent time in different martial arts practice rooms, along with various other sports hockey cycling weightlifting. My days I spend working as a scientist in medical research, and I also make time to work with athletes from many more sports who are looking to optimize their performance in their unique pursuit. 

Over time I began to recognize that certain athletes who excel in their respective sports express certain qualities when they come into my gym to train. There seemed to be some fundamental principles which they are dialled in to, either consciously or even subconsciously where they may not even be expressly aware. Overall, I’ve recognized that these certain principles which may govern our capabilities, our effectiveness in the most demanding physical situations. And in recognizing this, we can use this knowledge to intentionally design a system to set us up for success in achieving whatever our unique goal or pursuit might be. 

So this conversation today will be centred around some of these principles and actions that we can take and use to inform how we practice and prepare. I called this preparing for battle, since as martial artists I feel we understand that a thorough and diligent preparation, a wholistic preparation, equips us with whats needed to overcome any challenge, and that preparation for the most extreme makes us more than equipped for anything else which we may encounter. 

I don’t have any magic formulas short cuts or hacks, but I am hoping that we can all add some new tools to our training tool kit as athletes and as coaches to better ourselves a little each day. We will theorize a bit about what I see as high level ideas in training, maybe some fresh perspectives, and then we will go into some detail on real strategies that you can take and integrate directly into your own and your students training. 

There are some big overarching ideas I want us to keep in mind today, that is the fact that us as humans are extremely well evolved to adapt, and to adapt in order to survive. That is the fundamental reason we are today. This quality is also why we can train and develop incredible unique skills and excel in nearly anything we want, athletically or otherwise. This ability to adapt and survive, but not always thrive, is exactly how I like to look at training and performance. 

First of all, lets set up some context, 

Why do we train? Has anyone thought about what their reason is for training? What is your why?
Safe to say that we are all martial artists here, and I know that many of us perform other physical or mental training to improve in our martial arts pursuit. I want you to reflect on why and share this with the group. The why will help us understand the mindset we each bring to our training. 

The significance is that We want a mindset that is going to serve us in fulfilling that why. This is the lens through which we will interpret and design our system around health and performance.  

1. Your mindset 
Mindset is the first tool that you can sharpen to guide in refining all others. I know it might seem a bit cliche. I am not referring to something like having a positive attitude, or trying to “be happy” all of the time. In fact, I am encouraging the opposite. 

I am talking about creating awareness of your mindset and how this is shaping your experience. This clearly depends on the situation and demands. The goal then, is in developing a completely tuned demeanour and focus to excel in the task at hand or derive the intended outcome from the sport or activity. In our martial arts context, we can recognize that the if we bring the mindset from a hard sparring session into learning or refining kata, we may not be in the best state to accept new ideas and welcome some creativity or exploration. On the contrary, an openness and willingness to learn and understand might not serve us when someone is standing across the mat with the intention on kicking my head. 

The proper mindset is critical. 

So, how do we recognize what we need in a mindset for the situation at hand, and how do we move to where we need to be? 

Dr. Steve shared a very insightful lecture this morning and discussed a lot of interesting ideas around energy and expression and how certain energy creates physical expression. I want to tap into some of these ideas to inform our conversation on mindset. 

Dr. Steve mentioned the concept of baseline energy. Your set point, or your default operating mindset. This default setting is different for different people and at different times, its something that can and will change. But, this baseline is what we bring to the table when we approach a training session and we want to understand: does this serve me here?

We need to ask then, : what is my intent? What is my intention with this training or activity I am about to partake in?

The preparation for battle is holistic, it will see many parts and phases, which may culminate with the battle itself, the ultimate competition. 

Am I walking to the gym for training? I probably already have in my head what I’m expecting to do and encounter in 5-10 minutes of arriving. I may be weight training, cardio. Kata. 

That is my expectation, the training to follow,  but what is my why? 

How many people have asked themselves that question? Why do you practice martial arts, for example? And why the desire to improve in it?

Now we get to the core intention, the why, which is not only the best motivator to go after what you want, but it also informs how to go about doing it 

What are you up against? 
Training and competition 

So before training or coaching, decide on your why, set your intention, and use this to guide all of the next steps in this process. 
What is a next step, something really tangible that mindset also governs: 

Mindset also governs intensity 

2. Intensity

If you’re here as someone who’s practice martial arts you understand the significance and intensity this brings to training. Dr. Steve talked about the energy before a concert, Right now I am thinking about The energy in the testing room last night was amazing and the buzz that comes from everyone being hopped up.. Now contrasting this with a series of deep breathes, a parasympathetic state. Meditation, stillness. Very different level of intensity, governed by a different intention. 

Bringing the proper intensity to training or your practice is critical. 

Does anyone compete? I want to share an interesting anecdote from UFC fighter Cory Sandhagen talking about matching the intensity of his opponent, and the desire for stillness and calmness when that is not in line with your intention or demands of what you are up against. 

Matching the opponent with energy - matching the intensity to the intent of training. 

You compete with yourself in becoming better, that’s how you improve. So, how do you do it? What are some strategies if you’re training and living to get better than yesterday. 


Dr. Steve mentioned earlier that The healthiest can move through stages and between states. I see that the top performers do this too

Being able to flip a switch, move between states and turn up the intensity when its required and be accepting of the changes in physiology that come with this. 


3. Consistency or Routine  

I prefer to think of a consistent practice in improving as becoming routine, integrated into daily life. Being consistent with some practice is the intended outcome, becoming routine means it’s integrated into our lifestyle. 

Behaviours drive adaptations, whether these adaptations are favourable to our goals and intentions or not

Move between states for different intentions - not stuff in a parasympathetic. 

Patterns of being 
Intentional routine 


Lets now talk more practically, how can we incorporate an intentional mindset into our training, how can we tap into new levels of intensity and focus, how can we integrate these and make them a part of our internal tool kit using routine. 

First, mindset in training in practice. 
1. Set an intention 
2. Understand the demands or requirements 
3. Decide our set point
4. Iterate and adjust - be open to approaching things with different attitudes - weightlifting anecdote Syd in states, vs. powerlifting and complacent 

Coming along with the mindset is the level of intensity and focus. 

Has anyone ever become dizzy in the gym, or feeling like their sluggish and can’t overcome ? Or stay focused ? 
This is a state mismatch, where the intensity of the physical demands do not match the level of our physiology. This is the same in any other situation in life, where our internal state, our perception, is not in alignment with the demands of the situation. We can undershoot, in the sense of feeling weak or dizzy in the gym, and we can overshoot, feeling wound up and anxious and ready to go - just to talk on the phone with someone. In both cases, the mindset and physical expression is not aligned with our intention. 

How can we match these states? We can match them with rhythm and breathing. 

By synchronizing our breathing and movement, we not only bring our body and breath into alignment, we can now tap into an enhanced ability to push beyond our perceived limits. 

How many people in here have used a heart rate monitor during a workout? How high heart rate? How long, and what is average? 

What if you could maintain a higher average without the freak out feeling? This is with synchronizing the breath and movement. 

Breathe and bring awareness to your air. and the back of the throat 

Next, with breathing aligned with our body and movement, as we look to scale intensity for a greater demand, we use our breathing to do that. 
For strong kata, or stepping into battle with a sparring partner, we see that the low slow breathing is not going to result in the intensity we are going to require. 

Lets move through these states as a group - lets begin moving up the gradient, inhale nose exhale nose while marching - sync it up
Now marching bigger, inhale nose, exhale mouth more forcefully, Bigger stomps etc. bring intensity up, then lets make an audit of ourselves and how we feel here, 

Then, lets bring it back down leading with our breathing. 

Use this in your training to move between states from moment to moment, and to command different mindsets and levels of intensity when the situation requires. 

Routine, how do we make this habitual? As I said, I prefer to think of routine instead of discipline or consistency because routines can change and evolve as we integrate new ideas and activities and intentions. I like the openness to create what we want. 

Bring these principles of mindset, breathing and intensity into our daily routines of life. The gym, the dojo, our training rooms let us narrow down our focus. I like to use this time to practice the routine of aligning my mindset and intensity to my task since it is clear and definite. Then, grow and extend this to other areas of our life. 

Lets look on the flip side and another critical area for health and performance - eating. What sort of mindset and intensity do we want around eating? It should probably be very different than a sparring session. Without even changing the food we are eating, we can improve our bodies response to a food with our mindset and intensity, our state of being. 

I challenge you to chew and breath simultaneously - breathing through your nose is possible while chewing and is another example of synching our breathing with our movement or activity. If you find you gulp for air while eating, fill up with air and feel bloated right away, youre eating air. Keep them separate, define the proper state to accept the food and digest. 

I have done countless personal experiments on myself, measuring my glycemic response to foods - i found my body would higher blood glucose spikes when not in the right state, my body is ready for another level of stress and making sugar readily available for my muscles to react. 

Ok, lets think about intensity and some classic training concepts. How many people train with a barbell or dumbbells? How many people compete against humans? 


My fav training tool - sandbag - no tech, intense, variable, maximum exertion to mimic the most extreme demands

We want to go to the extremes and learn about ourselves here, become comfortable here and familiar with how to operate. 

Ideally, testing day is not the first time you are feeling the crucible of pressure.
