Your patellar tendonitis is an alignment problem more than a load problem - this is why prescribed rehab is always more (controlled) loading and retraining of movement, even if it is .  

Healthy tendons and connective tissue are incredibly resilient and adaptable to loads applied by your muscles, assuming the forces are applied in appropriate directions.  Issues begin to arise as increasing loads are applied with imbalance in the kinetic chain.  

The common example is characterized by certain physical patterns and tendencies - chronically short TFL, IT band, piriformis, 

The knee is a “passive” component in a sense - its behaviour is dictated by the function of the foot and hip.  Any amount of disfunction in the up or downstream components will be reflected in control at the knee.  
Foot and hip function dictates knee function in many ways.  Weakness and lack of coordination among the intrinsic foot muscles, glutes, and deep core stabilizers produces unbalanced forces on the knee.  Each component must be functioning properly to minimize stress to the knee.  Once movement and function is corrected, rehabilitation and strengthening of the tendon can begin.   

1. ’Short Foot’, Glute, and Core Coordination and Strengthening 

Practice recruiting intrinsic foot muscles and make it a habit to do so while standing/walking/climbing stairs/etc.  

Exercise 
Lift and spread toes as far as possible while standing.  Take note of arch height and foot position
Maintain this arched position and place spread toes back on the ground
Now think of squeezing the bottom of the foot to raise your arch higher, and push your toes into the ground
Repeat as frequently as possible, holding tension for 10s each time

Practice spreading toes while standing and walking.  

Once you can achieve this foot shape and begin to recruit the intrinsic foot muscles, it’s important to recruit and coordinate with core and glutes.  This exercise from Dr. Emily Splichal works really well for this.

This coordination is something which should be maintained during squatting or any other dynamic loading.  To reinforce the recruitment pattern, practice the following series of exercises.

Practice both of these exercises barefoot 3-4 times daily (morning, pre and post training, evening)

	Biomechanics of the foot are intimately tied to core stability and glute function.  Thick soled shoes that are stiff and absorb ground impact forces prevent the foot from receiving important sensory input.  Without this input, intrinsic muscles responsible for maintenance of foot structure fail to be recruited and weaken over time.  This disfunction also results in lack of recruitment of glutes and deep core.  By correcting the function of the foot, it becomes possible to effectively recruit the muscular system in the way necessary for proper knee and hip function.  
	Once the foot mechanics are corrected and glute and core recruitment is maintained during squatting and other dynamic loading, movement should begin to follow a pattern that is not aggravating to the tendon and you can begin to rehabilitate and manage inflammation.  

2. Tendon Rehabilitation and Strengthening 

	The following drills should be done to strengthen and rehabilitate the tendon while maintaining the foot position and coordination explained in part 1.  

    Exercise 
    Heel Elevated Single Leg Squat
    Use a block, step, or 25kg plate to elevate the heel.  
    Break at the hip and knee and begin to squat with one leg - descend as slowly as possible 
    Maintain vertical shin (!!!!) and externally rotated knee
    Emphasize ‘sitting back’, eccentric loading
    When the descent becomes painful or you are unable to maintain external rotation, place the opposite foot back on the ground and stand up
    Repeat for sets of 10-20 per leg
    Steady yourself by holding on to something if needed
    Eventually aim to perform sets of 10-20 without assistance of other leg

    Slowly increase the ROM with this exercise, doing it as many times per day as possible. 

    Exercise 
    Wall Sit
    Maintain strong foot and knee out
    Can start with less knee angle, increase depth of squat as pain allows
    Hold for as long as possible, repeat 3-5 times

    Exercise 
    Leg Extension 
    Focus on contracting VMO
    Slight internal rotation of leg when extended
    Light weight, sets of 20

    Exercise
    Single Leg Deadlift with Kettlebell 
    Hold kettlebell on same side as foot you are balancing on 
    Set foot position - press toes into ground and raise arch
    Add slight knee bend and externally rotate leg, drawing arch up
    Hinge at hip, let kettlebell hang towards toe
    At end range of hamstring, pause and return to upright position
    Sets of 10 per side





3. Soft Tissue Work 

	Cross friction massage of the patellar tendon should be done as often as possible.  Rub across the tendon with your fingers, beginning at the shin bone and working your way up over the patella applying as much pressure as you can tolerate.  Can be done while adding knee extension.  
	
	Releasing the TFL, piriformis, glute med (and other small hip rotators), QL, and psoas will also be very beneficial.  I suggest spending 5-10 minutes on each area after training and before sleep, sitting on the ground and using baseball to apply pressure to the gnarly-feeling spots and hanging out until the tissue begins to normalize.  When working on the hip rotators and glutes, add hip extension and rotation while massaging an area - think ART.  I would also suggest to similarly release rectus femoris and sartorius, along with the back of the calf and heel cord.  
	
	Bottom of foot should be massaged with a baseball or similar.  Place a ball under the foot and apply as much pressure as tolerable, flexing and extending toes, rolling laterally over uncomfortable tissue.  Spend 5 mins per foot and repeat 2-3 timesn
