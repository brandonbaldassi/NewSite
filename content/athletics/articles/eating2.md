Does it matter what I eat? 

Your body is not a calorimeter, and it does not interpret everything we ingest the same way you read the calories off a label.  We have evolved as incredibly versatile species, able to leverage multiple energy pathways and fuel sources depending on the resources available to us (or lack of).  But one of our most unique evolutionary traits for surviving on numerous fuel sources is thanks to something that isn’t even us.   

The microbiota of the gut is a wildly diverse environment with more genetic material than we are human.  It creates our body’s most complex interface with the outside world, and without it, we have no hope of assimilating the calories or nutrients to provide life as we know it.  

If we think to a time where our only options for sustenance were to hunt and forage, it becomes increasingly unrealistic that we were consuming the same precisely regulated quantities of the same foods at the same times, every day.  In fact, this practice is one that is directly associated with low biodiversity and health of the gut.

<figcaption>The gut microbiome is a community of tens of trillions of cells, each uniquely interacting with the outside world.  A calorimeter is a metal vessel that measures the thermal energy provided by combustion of a food.</figcaption>

In our modern world, most of us are able to live in a consumable abundance.  We are able to eat as much as we want, of whatever we want, whenever we want.  This attitude toward abundance and consumption is something that we can directly lay over the broadening distribution of metabolic disease and beyond. 

So, why does it matter what I eat, and why should we eat in the context of gut health? (versus a metal box that burns things, regardless of what the chosen epidemiological study might conclude)

At this point, we are obviously talking about food and feeding in the context of improving health, longevity, and performance, which differs from looking at it to just affect a global variable like ‘body weight’.  In fact, you will often find that in applying these principles and addressing your digestive health first, you will note marked changes in body composition (read: leaner) without having to weigh your chicken breast or count your almonds for the day.  

Dr. Peter Attia talks of his approach to a fundamental framework for eating that he implements in his practice, aimed at curtailing the consumable abundance we are faced with daily.  He describes a ‘three-lever’ approach.  *infographic.  

This is an excellent simplistic approach to fundamentals of health and longevity to lay the base for any ‘diet’.  However, as athletes and those looking to optimize their health and performance, we can go another layer deeper and further expand our framework.
