    My research interests in the physics of medical imaging focus on development of novel <b><em>positron emission tomography (PET) technology for current and emerging clinical applications</em></b>, <b><em>solid-state imaging sensors, reconstruction algorithms,</b></em> and <b><em>novel radiotracers.</b></em> I am proud of my involvement in the development and commercialization of the <a href="https://www.radialis.com" target="_blank">Radialis PET Imager</a>, offering best-in-class performance and seeing clinical use for a variety of indications, from breast cancer to Alzheimer's disease. I have also accrued expertise in achieving and maintaining regulatory compliance (FDA, Health Canada) and building and maintaining medical device manufacturer quality management systems (ISO 13485:2016, MDSAP).
