        <!-- <h2>Research Title</h2> -->
        <p>My passion and curiosity for physics and medicine guided me to the world of <em>medical imaging</em>, where I've focused on advancing <a href="https://cancer.ca/en/treatments/tests-and-procedures/positron-emission-tomography-pet-scan" target="_blank"> <b><em>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) </em></b></a> to address shortcomings in current technologies and improve patient outcomes. My research spans the development of novel <b><em>PET imaging systems, solid-state imaging sensors,</b></em> and <b><em>advanced reconstruction algorithms</b></em> for clinical applications.</p>
        <p>
        I am particularily proud of my role in the development and commercialization of the <a href="https://www.radialis.com" target="_blank">Radialis PET Imager</a>, a breakthrough organ-targeted PET device that delivers <em><b>best-in-class performance</em></b> and is used for the detection and management of diseases ranging from <em><b>breast cancer</em></b> to <em><b>Alzheimer's</em></b>.</p> 
        <p>
        Beyond this, I have extensive experience in regulatory compliance (FDA, Health Canada) and in building and maintaining medical device quality management systems (ISO 13485:2016, MDSAP), ensuring that innovation exceeds the highest standards of safety and effectiveness.
