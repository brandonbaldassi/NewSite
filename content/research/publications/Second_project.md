## Abstract

Although cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is the most widely used room-temperature photoconductor for low ﬂux radiation sensing, utilization of this promising material in high ﬂux applications, like computed tomography is challenging, due to possible dynamic polarization. Indeed, trapping of the X-ray-generated charge may cause space charge build-up and electric ﬁeld distortion. Combining the conventional time-of-ﬂight and the photo-generated charge extraction by linear increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) techniques, we track changes of the main electrodynamic parameters (such as electric potential and intrinsic electric ﬁeld) of CZT under various ﬂuxes. In addition, we investigate transport properties of electrons and holes in a wide range of temperatures and electric ﬁelds. Multiple trapping was found to govern the hole transport, while electrons conduct electrical current via various scattering mechanisms.
