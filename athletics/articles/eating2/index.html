But one of our most unique evolutionary traits for surviving on numerous fuel sources is thanks to something that isn’t even us.\nThe microbiota of the gut is a wildly diverse environment with more genetic material than we are human. It creates our body’s most complex interface with the outside world, and without it, we have no hope of assimilating the calories or nutrients to provide life as we know it.\nIf we think to a time where our only options for sustenance were to hunt and forage, it becomes increasingly unrealistic that we were consuming the same precisely regulated quantities of the same foods at the same times, every day. In fact, this practice is one that is directly associated with low biodiversity and health of the gut.\nThe gut microbiome is a community of tens of trillions of cells, each uniquely interacting with the outside world. A calorimeter is a metal vessel that measures the thermal energy provided by combustion of a food. In our modern world, most of us are able to live in a consumable abundance. We are able to eat as much as we want, of whatever we want, whenever we want. This attitude toward abundance and consumption is something that we can directly lay over the broadening distribution of metabolic disease and beyond.\nSo, why does it matter what I eat, and why should we eat in the context of gut health?
