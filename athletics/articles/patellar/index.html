I suggest spending 5-10 minutes on each area after training and before sleep, sitting on the ground and using baseball to apply pressure to the gnarly-feeling spots and hanging out until the tissue begins to normalize. When working on the hip rotators and glutes, add hip extension and rotation while massaging an area - think ART.

<li>
<p>Tendon Rehabilitation and Strengthening</p>
<p>The following drills should be done to strengthen and rehabilitate the tendon while maintaining the foot position and coordination explained in part 1.</p>
<p>Exercise
Heel Elevated Single Leg Squat
Use a block, step, or 25kg plate to elevate the heel.<br>
Break at the hip and knee and begin to squat with one leg - descend as slowly as possible
Maintain vertical shin (!!!!) and externally rotated knee
Emphasize ‘sitting back’, eccentric loading
When the descent becomes painful or you are unable to maintain external rotation, place the opposite foot back on the ground and stand up
Repeat for sets of 10-20 per leg
Steady yourself by holding on to something if needed
Eventually aim to perform sets of 10-20 without assistance of other leg</p>
<p>Slowly increase the ROM with this exercise, doing it as many times per day as possible.</p>
<p>Exercise
Wall Sit
Maintain strong foot and knee out
Can start with less knee angle, increase depth of squat as pain allows
Hold for as long as possible, repeat 3-5 times</p>
<p>Exercise
Leg Extension
Focus on contracting VMO
Slight internal rotation of leg when extended
Light weight, sets of 20</p>
<p>Exercise
Single Leg Deadlift with Kettlebell
Hold kettlebell on same side as foot you are balancing on
Set foot position - press toes into ground and raise arch
Add slight knee bend and externally rotate leg, drawing arch up
Hinge at hip, let kettlebell hang towards toe
At end range of hamstring, pause and return to upright position
Sets of 10 per side</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft Tissue Work</p>
<p>Cross friction massage of the patellar tendon should be done as often as possible.  Rub across the tendon with your fingers, beginning at the shin bone and working your way up over the patella applying as much pressure as you can tolerate.  Can be done while adding knee extension.</p>
